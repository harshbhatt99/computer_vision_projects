# Computer Vision Projects
This repository contains projects related to Computer Vision. The projects include • Basic Image Processing • Basic Video Processing • Face Detection • Object Segmentation • Object Recognition • Depth Analysis

## Getting Started
This folder contains the codes with some basic image processing and video processing techniques. 

### Basic Feature Extraction
This file contains the codes for the operations like finding contours for separate objects, finding contours for overlapping objects, and shape detection.

### Basic Image Processing
This file contains basic image processing operations.

### Basic Image Thresholding
This file contains the list and use of various thresholding that can be applied to the image. This is useful to quickly run the code to see the thresholding effect on the image and then using it to append the complex image processing tasks.

### Basic Image Transformations
This file contains the codes related to affine transformations and image histograms. Comments and notes contains the interpretations of each step.

### Basic Video Processing
This file contains basic codes about starting the webcam, processing the live feed on the fly and saving the clip in the local drive. It is useful to append any complex image processing tasks.

### Face-Eyes Detection
This mini project uses the conventional Haar Cascade Classifier to annotate the face and eyes in live video stream.

### Overlapping Object Detection
This notebook uses Watershed algorithm to identify the overlapping and touching objects and find the contours for these objects. The code contains the use of morphological operations and euclidean distance transform to separate foreground and background of the image and get the object boundaries.

## ML Algorithms on Images
This folder contains the files on how to use various Machine Learning algorithms on images for different applications.

### Color Quantization with KMeans
Any multi color random image consists of high number of distinguishable colors. Processing these images can be computationally expensive. This mini project uses KMeans clustering algorithms to identify the set number of clusters (colors) and reduce the number of colors without loosing more information.
